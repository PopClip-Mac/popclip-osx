## What is PopClip?  

**PopClip** is a versatile productivity tool designed to make text selection faster, smarter, and more intuitive on macOS. The moment you highlight text anywhere—be it in a document, browser, or email—PopClip appears, offering immediate access to essential actions like **copy, paste, search, translate, or share** without extra keystrokes.  

The real power of PopClip lies in its **extensible system of extensions**, which allows you to add new capabilities tailored to your workflow. Users can automate repetitive tasks, transform text formats, insert emojis, perform calculations, or integrate with other applications—turning a simple text selection into a highly productive action hub.  

PopClip shines in various scenarios:  
- **Writers and editors** can instantly check definitions, grammar, or translate text, speeding up content creation.  
- **Developers** can perform quick code searches, convert text formats, or insert boilerplate snippets directly.  
- **Designers and researchers** working on text-heavy projects benefit from instant formatting, lookup, and annotation capabilities.  
- **Students and knowledge workers** can quickly capture quotes, references, or research material without disrupting their workflow.  

Other benefits include:  
- **Seamless integration** with macOS apps and web browsers, making it compatible with nearly any workflow.  
- **Customizable behavior**, letting you tailor PopClip’s appearance, triggers, and actions to your personal preferences.  
- **Lightweight design**, optimized for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, so it runs smoothly in the background without affecting system performance.  
- **Productivity enhancement**, turning every text selection into a potential workflow shortcut, reducing repetitive tasks, and saving time.
